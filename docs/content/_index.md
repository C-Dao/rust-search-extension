Currentlyï¼Œwe only support search documentation of those official crates:

- **proc_macro**
- **test**

# Search Structs, Traits and Enums

# Search Functions, Methods and Macros

# Search builtin attributes

Search builtin attributes (such as `derive`, `non_exhaustive`) are also supported, 
by default, the result is mixed with other related docs or crates though. 

If you prefer to search attribute exclusively, prefix a **#** (pound sign) before the keyword to narrow the result.

# Search doc with type mode

You can prefix a type to get the exclusive search result. Those type keywords including:
- mod
- struct
- enum
- fn
- trait
- type
- static
- macro
- const

For example, `fn:asref` to search function or `trait:iterator` to search trait.

# Search top 20K crates

We build top 20K crates (35+k in total on crates.io) index every 12 hours to help you search crates instantly. 
You can open the popup page to sync the latest crates index automatically. ([Some caveats](/how-it-works/#caveats) 
for Firefox users.)

What more, you can prefix an **!** (exclamation mark) before the keyword to search crates exclusively, 
prefix one more **!** to open [docs.rs](https://docs.rs) page instead [crates.io](https://crates.io) page!
